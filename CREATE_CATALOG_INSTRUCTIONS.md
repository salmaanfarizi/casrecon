## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### 1. **Product Codes Must Match**
The codes in the catalog **must exactly match** the codes in your inventory sheets.
- The script automatically extracts codes from your sheets
- Don't change codes unless you also update inventory sheets

### 2. **If Catalog Already Exists**
When you run the script and a catalog exists:
- You'll get a prompt: "Replace existing catalog?"
- **YES**: Creates fresh catalog from current inventory (loses manual edits)
- **NO**: Keeps existing catalog

### 3. **What Sheets Are Scanned**
The script scans these tabs:
- Al-Hasa 1
- Al-Hasa 2
- Al-Hasa 3
- Al-Hasa 4
- Al-Hasa Wholesale

### 4. **Column Requirements**
Your inventory sheets should have:
- ‚úÖ **Code** column (required - product code/SKU)
- ‚úÖ **Item Name** or **Product** column (optional - helps with names)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Error: "No products found"
**Cause**: Script couldn't find "Code" column in your sheets
**Fix**: Make sure your inventory sheets have a column named exactly "Code"

### Error: "Sheet not found: Al-Hasa 1"
**Cause**: Tab name doesn't match exactly
**Fix**: Make sure tabs are named exactly as listed (case-sensitive)

### Prices seem wrong
**Cause**: Script uses smart defaults based on product names
**Fix**: Just edit the prices directly in the catalog! That's what it's for.

### Want to add a product manually?
**How**:
1. Go to Product Catalog tab
2. Click on empty row at bottom
3. Type: Category, Code, Name, Unit, Price
4. Done!

---

## üîÑ Re-running the Script

You can run it again anytime to:
- Rebuild catalog from scratch
- Pick up new products from inventory
- Reset to smart defaults

**Warning**: Re-running will replace your manually edited prices!

**Best Practice**:
- Run once to create
- Edit prices manually after
- Only re-run if you add many new products to inventory

---

## ‚úÖ After Creating Catalog

### Next Steps:

1. **Review the catalog**
   - Check if product names make sense
   - Verify prices are reasonable
   - Edit any prices that are wrong

2. **Deploy the backend**
   - Follow `BACKEND_DEPLOY.md` instructions
   - The backend will now use your custom catalog!

3. **Test the app**
   - Clear browser cache (`/clear-cache.html`)
   - Select a route
   - Click "Fetch from Inventory"
   - You should see your products with correct prices!
