# Sales Calculation Update - What Changed

## üéØ What You Asked For

> "The calculation should be: **Previous day physical stock + Previous day stock transfer - Current physical stock**"
>
> "The problem is sometimes there are non-working days, so we need to use the **last day which has data** instead of literally 'previous day'"

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed

### Old Calculation (WRONG)
```
Sales = Opening Stock + Purchases - Closing Stock
```

Problems:
- ‚ùå Assumed yesterday always has data
- ‚ùå Broke on weekends/holidays
- ‚ùå Didn't include stock transfers

### New Calculation (CORRECT)
```
Sales = Previous Day Closing Stock + Previous Day Stock Transfer + Current Day Purchases - Current Day Closing Stock
```

Where **"Previous Day" = Last date with actual data** (not literally yesterday)

Benefits:
- ‚úÖ Automatically finds last available date
- ‚úÖ Handles weekends, holidays, gaps
- ‚úÖ Includes stock transfers
- ‚úÖ Shows you which date was used

## üìä Example: Weekend Gap

### Your Inventory Sheet:
```
Date       | Code | Closing Stock | Stock Transfer | Purchases
-----------+------+---------------+----------------+-----------
2025-10-17 | 4402 | 100          | 20             | 0
           | (Friday - last working day)
2025-10-18 | (Saturday - NO DATA)
2025-10-19 | (Sunday - NO DATA)
2025-10-20 | 4402 | 150          | 0              | 80
           | (Monday - current day)
```

### What Happens:

**Old Logic** (broken):
- Looks for 2025-10-19 (Sunday) ‚Üí Not found
- Might fail or use zeros ‚Üí **WRONG RESULT**

**New Logic** (smart):
1. Current date: Monday (Oct 20)
2. Searches backward for last available date
3. Finds: Friday (Oct 17) ‚Üê 3 days ago
4. Uses Friday's data:
   - Closing Stock: 100
   - Stock Transfer: 20

**Calculation**:
```
Sales = 100 (Fri closing) + 20 (Fri transfer) + 80 (Mon purchases) - 150 (Mon closing)
Sales = 50 units ‚úÖ
```

**What You See**:
> ‚úÖ Sales calculated! Using data from 2025-10-17 (3 days ago)

## üîß What Changed in the Code

### Backend (gas-backend/Code.gs)

**New logic**:
1. Finds all dates in inventory sheet before current date
2. Sorts them and picks the most recent one
3. Uses that date as "previous day"
4. Calculates sales with correct formula

**Response includes metadata**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [...],
  "metadata": {
    "currentDate": "2025-10-20",
    "lastAvailableDate": "2025-10-17",
    "daysGap": 3,
    "message": "Using data from 2025-10-17 (3 days ago)"
  }
}
```

### Frontend (app.js)

**Shows smart message**:
- Normal day: "Using data from 2025-10-19 (1 day ago)"
- After weekend: "Using data from 2025-10-17 (3 days ago)"
- After holiday: "Using data from 2025-10-09 (11 days ago)"

## üìù Inventory Sheet Requirements

### Required Columns:
1. **Date** - Entry date (YYYY-MM-DD)
2. **Code** - Product SKU
3. **Closing Stock** - Stock at end of day
4. **Purchases** - New stock received (optional, defaults to 0)

### Optional Column:
5. **Stock Transfer** - Stock transferred between locations (defaults to 0 if missing)

### Example Sheet Structure:
```
Date       | Code | Product Name         | Opening Stock | Purchases | Stock Transfer | Closing Stock
-----------+------+----------------------+---------------+-----------+----------------+--------------
2025-10-17 | 4402 | Sunflower Seeds 200g | 100          | 50        | 20             | 130
2025-10-17 | 4401 | Sunflower Seeds 100g | 75           | 0         | 10             | 65
2025-10-20 | 4402 | Sunflower Seeds 200g | 0            | 100       | 0              | 120
2025-10-20 | 4401 | Sunflower Seeds 100g | 0            | 50        | 0              | 85
```

**Note**: You don't need Opening Stock - it's calculated from previous closing + transfer

## üß™ How to Test

### Test 1: Normal Consecutive Days
1. Add inventory for Oct 19
2. Add inventory for Oct 20
3. Click "Fetch from Inventory" on Oct 20
4. **Expected**: "Using data from 2025-10-19 (1 day ago)"

### Test 2: Weekend Gap
1. Add inventory for Oct 17 (Friday)
2. Skip Oct 18-19 (weekend - no data)
3. Add inventory for Oct 20 (Monday)
4. Click "Fetch from Inventory" on Oct 20
5. **Expected**: "Using data from 2025-10-17 (3 days ago)"

### Test 3: Holiday Gap
1. Add inventory for Oct 9
2. Skip Oct 10-18 (holiday week - no data)
3. Add inventory for Oct 19
4. Click "Fetch from Inventory" on Oct 19
5. **Expected**: "Using data from 2025-10-09 (10 days ago)"

### Test 4: First Entry Ever
1. New sheet with only today's data
2. Click "Fetch from Inventory"
3. **Expected**: Uses 0 for previous stock/transfer
4. Sales = Purchases - Closing Stock

## üîç Debugging

### Check the Logs

If something doesn't look right:

1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Open your backend script
3. **View** ‚Üí **Executions**
4. Find the latest `calculateSalesFromInventory` execution
5. Check the logs:
   ```
   Current Date: 2025-10-20
   Last Available Date (with data): 2025-10-17
   ```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "No inventory data found"
- **Cause**: No data for current date
- **Fix**: Ensure inventory sheet has data for the selected date

**Issue**: Sales seem wrong
- **Check**: Which date was used? Look at the success message
- **Verify**: That date's closing stock + transfer + today's purchases - today's closing

**Issue**: "Stock Transfer" column not found
- **Solution**: It's optional! System will use 0 for transfers

## üöÄ Deployment

### If Backend is Already Deployed:

You need to **redeploy** the backend with the updated code:

1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Open your cash reconciliation backend script
3. **Copy the updated `gas-backend/Code.gs`** from this repo
4. **Paste it** to replace your current Code.gs
5. **Deploy** ‚Üí **Manage deployments**
6. Click the **pencil icon** ‚úèÔ∏è next to your active deployment
7. **Version**: Select "New version"
8. Click **Deploy**

**No need to change the URL** - it stays the same!

### If Frontend is Already Deployed:

Netlify will auto-deploy the updated `app.js` with the next push, or:

1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. **Deploys** ‚Üí **Trigger deploy** ‚Üí **Deploy site**
