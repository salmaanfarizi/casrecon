## Template 3: Cash Destination Sheet

**Purpose**: Written by Cash App (auto-created by GAS script)

### The GAS script will auto-create 3 tabs:

#### Tab 1: Cash Reconciliation
Headers auto-created:
```
Timestamp | Date | Route | Total Sales | Discount Base | Discount w/VAT | Credit Sales | Credit Repay | Bank POS | Bank Transfer | Cheque | Expected Cash | Cash Notes | Coins | Actual Cash | Difference | Items Sold
```

#### Tab 2: Transactions
Headers auto-created:
```
Timestamp | Date | Route | Category | Code | Item Name | Unit | Price | Quantity | Total
```

#### Tab 3: Cash Denominations
Headers auto-created:
```
Timestamp | Date | Route | 500 SAR | 100 SAR | 50 SAR | 20 SAR | 10 SAR | 5 SAR | 2 SAR | 1 SAR | 0.50 SAR | 0.25 SAR | Total Notes | Total Coins | Total Cash
```

**You don't need to create anything** - just create a blank Google Sheet and let the GAS script populate it on first save.

## Sample Google Sheets Formulas

### In Inventory Sheet: Auto-calculate Sales
If you want to add a "Sales" column for reference:

```
Column G: Sales
Formula in G2: =D2+E2-F2
(assuming D=Opening, E=Purchases, F=Closing)
```

### In Cash Destination: Summary Report
Create a separate "Daily Summary" tab:

```
=QUERY('Cash Reconciliation'!A:Q,
  "SELECT B, C, SUM(D), SUM(O), COUNT(A)
   WHERE B >= date '"&TEXT(TODAY()-7,"yyyy-MM-dd")&"'
   GROUP BY B, C
   ORDER BY B DESC", 1)
```
This creates a weekly summary by route.

### Conditional Formatting for Cash Difference

In the Cash Reconciliation tab, highlight differences:

1. Select column P (Difference)
2. Format → Conditional formatting
3. Format rules:
   - **Red**: Custom formula = `=P2<0` (shortage)
   - **Green**: Custom formula = `=AND(P2>=0, P2>0)` (excess)
   - **Blue**: Custom formula = `=P2=0` (balanced)

## Sharing & Permissions

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups (Recommended)

Create a Google Apps Script in your sheets:

```javascript
function createDailyBackup() {
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  const backupFolder = DriveApp.getFolderById('YOUR_BACKUP_FOLDER_ID');

  const today = Utilities.formatDate(new Date(), 'GMT+3', 'yyyy-MM-dd');
  const backupName = ss.getName() + ' - Backup - ' + today;

  ss.copy(backupName).moveTo(backupFolder);
}
```

Set up a time-driven trigger (daily at 11:59 PM).
